You've learned a lot about web development so far. 
I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  

* What has been easy?
  

* What has been difficult?
  

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

•What new skills have you learned?

I revised some points in the web page "building", learned new html elements, and its properties that can change them visually.
Indentified some visual patterns and "factorized" them into the CSS. Initially you do an analisys as a start point, but carefully, so the CSS can start and stays minimally well-structured as you need to change it, editing the HTML and iterating through testing the "boxes" and visually comparing the page being construted with the mockup image.
(The analisys, although visual, can be done, and after modeling a "mental" project or plan in mind, carefully and allocating time for this, then I start with some similar html and css that already had made and is functioning without "errors".
Then I enter into the details and iterate to capture every detail and mapping it directly in the HTML or through CSS.

•What has been easy?

Analysing and mentally making a logical propject using the concepts of "boxes" and others structural elements. 
Starting with some already well done work that I identified as a kind of "pattern".

•What has been difficult?

Identifying which font was used. I tried two sites but both failed by far, so I choose a font that I consider usual and alike. This part I did not very well.
See some subtle details;

•How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

-Used Mozilla guide development site search for new elements like <hr>, <strike> (<s>) and StackOverflow for the horizontal rule "stressing";
-Used other project as a starting point after an anlysis and mapping to the most near "pattern" I could identified;
-Used CSS to speed up the development, mainly in the several last iterations to modify and be near to the mockup image.
